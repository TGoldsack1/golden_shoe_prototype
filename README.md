# AND Digital interview solution prototype 
This repository contains the implementation of my recommended solutions regarding the Golden Show case study, in prototype form. 
 
The front-end (client) is written in ReactJs and the back-end (server) is written in NodeJs.

## Usage
Both the client and server can be run separately from the command line using 'npm start' after installing node packages using 'npm i'.

To login, the user credentials are:
- email: 'test@user.com'
- password: 'password'

## Solutions prototyped:
- Olark livechat added for customer service purposes, implemented using Segment integration to allow easy integration of other 3rd party apps.
- Mobile responsiveness
- Ability to send and apply discount codes for website (marketing)
- Size guide simulated for products
- Fixed 'being able to purchase out of stock items' design flaw
- Social media sharing only from product page
